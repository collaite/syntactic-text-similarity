# syntactic-text-similarity
Investigates the performance of state of the art syntactic text similarity algorithms such as [levenshtein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance), [hamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) and [jaccard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) distance for matching similar textual context across multiple versions of a Dutch literary work.

### File descriptions for this repo:

```

### Required input data:

In the CollAIte project we are applying this analysis to multiple versions of the "Projectielantaarn Aladin" manuscript by [Raymond Brulez](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Brulez). The required input data is four plain text .txt files indicating the different versions (also called witnesses) of "Projectielantaarn Aladin". Each witness is referred to as W1, W2, W3 and W4.

### Running the script:

**Requirements:**
1. Python 3.7+
2. Git

**Steps:**
1. Clone this repo (``git clone git@github.com:collaite/syntactic-text-similarity.git``)
2. Change into the ``syntactic-text-similarity/`` directory
3. Run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` in the terminal or console (optionally create and activate a virtual environment using something like [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) before running this command)
4. Ensuring that you have the required input data as indicated above, you may execute the `semantic-similarity-syntacticmetrics.ipynb` notebook to run the text similarity calculations.
5. Thereafter, run the `analyse-syntactic-results.ipynb` as desired to explore the results dataset.
6. Run `sampling-strategy.ipynb` for selecting a manageable sample of the text similarity calculations for validation by human text scholars.
